# 1.0. Digital Learning Resources Management API
## 1.1. Introduction to Digital Learning Resources Management API
Our goal is to build a digital learning resources management API that facilitates easy retrieval of resources when an individual wants to learn about a specific topic. This project is inspired by our personal learning experiences, where we often come across valuable resources but lack a proper system to keep track of them.

## 1.2. The Problem Statement
We currently lose about 10 important digital documents every month that could have assisted us in advancing our learning on specific topics. Without a properly organized system, we spend significant time searching for lost resources or trying to recall their names, which slows down or even stops our learning. We need a way to keep track of and record all relevant and useful resources we come across during our research.

## 1.3. The Solution
The digital learning resources management API will address this challenge by providing a system to store and manage all the materials we find. With this API, we will be able to:
* Save resources in a centralized database for easy access
* Retrieve resources when needed, without wasting time searching for them
* Keep track of our progress and stay organized
* Achieve our learning goals within the planned time frame with ease

## 1.4. Key Features
The API will allow users to:
* Add, update, retrieve, or delete resources as needed
* Access a learning log to jot down notes and reflections
* Bookmark favorite materials for future reference
* Keep track of progress, whether in the middle of a resource, completed, or marked as a priority

## 1.5. The Big Picture
By implementing the digital learning resources management API, we aim to create a system that will enable us to achieve our learning goals efficiently and effectively. With this API, we will be able to take control of our digital learning journey and make the most out of the resources we come across.
